# Implementation
This repository contains implementations of Genetic Programming based on DEAP and of BC, DQN, REM and CQL.

Experiments are managed through experimental files (ex_01.py, ex_02.py, ex_gp_01 ...).
The results can be reproduced via running the experiments for both environments, joining the csv files (join_csv_files.py) and
then via the "create_plots" python files for the respective research question.

## Dependencies
To reproduce all results we provide a requirement.txt
